<p>My name is Anirudh, and I am in the final year of my Computer Science and Engineering degree. With a CGPA of 8.2 and a
solid academic foundation, including strong scores in both 10th and 12th grades, I am passionate about building a
successful career in web development. My journey in this field began during my internship at Dlithe Consultancy
Services, where I gained hands-on experience in web development. I am excited to further enhance my skills through
another internship soon, solidifying my knowledge and practical expertise.</p>

<p>In addition to my technical aspirations, I have a deep interest in Japanese culture and language. I am certified in N5
and N4 levels of Japanese and am currently studying at the N3 level. My ultimate goal is to work in Japan as a web
developer, combining my passion for technology with my love for Japanese culture. I am actively honing my skills in both
web development and the Japanese language to achieve this dream, ensuring I am well-prepared for opportunities in
Japan's dynamic tech industry.</p>

<p>Outside academics and career pursuits, I enjoy spending time on hobbies like reading, swimming, and playing cricket.
These activities help me stay balanced and energized, allowing me to approach challenges with focus and determination. I
am driven, eager to learn, and committed to excelling in my chosen field, both locally and globally.</p>
